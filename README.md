### Rust Guessing Game in multiple languages

In this repo, I’m collecting implementations of the Rust tutorial’s Guessing Game in multiple programming languages.

This project is not about performance or best practices in each language, but about exploring different syntaxes, paradigms, and basic language features by implementing the same simple game.

### Gameplay Rules

-   The program generates a random number with a range of 0 ≤ n < 100
-   The random number should be different each time the game is run (i.e., seeded randomness if required)
-   Input should be read as string to allow checking for non-numeric input and "q"
-   The user has to guess the number by typing guesses
-   The program counts the number of guesses
-   The user can quit the program at any time by typing "q"
-   The program must not crash on invalid input
-   When the user won, he is prompted, if he/she wants to play again
-   The user can confirm this question with y/n

### Technical Constraints

-   Use at least one extra include file
-   Use at least one loop
-   Use at least one if clause
-   Use at least one function/method (if the language supports it)
-   Use meaningful variable names (no x, y, or tmp unless unavoidable)
-   Keep the code as simple and readable as possible – greetings to Uncle Bob...
-   Avoid external libraries (unless absolutely necessary for randomness or input)

Feel free to contribute your own version in any language – even esoteric ones! Pull requests welcome.
