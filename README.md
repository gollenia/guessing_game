## Rust Guessing Game in multiple languages

In this repo, I am collecting the Rust-Tutorial Guessing Game in different languages. It is for comparing languages and learning their basic syntax

### Rules

- The program generates a random number between 0 and 99
- The user has to guess the number by typing guesses
- The program counts the number of guesses
- The user can quit the program at any time by typing ni "q"
- When the user won, he is prompted, if he/she wants to play again
- The user can confirm this question with y/n
